Summary:
Tired of hacking all night? Frustrated with debugging? Now you can take it out on an AR debugging rubber duck!
Open our AR game controller on your mobile device, direct the camera at a marker image, and the duck appears ready
to receive your burning fury! Run with web sockets (NOT YET), you can fight the duck with your teammates for
quicker defeat!

Features:
– Mobile controller with individual player AR view of rubber duck
– AR view allows for attack of duck when camera directed at marker image using a button
– Vibration and SFX when attack button is pressed (1 of 5 squeaks depending on damage)
– Each attack shrinks the duck proportionally based on attack value
– When duck shrinks to 0, it is defeated, and a victory message appears (prevents further button clicks indefinitely)
